[h1]Neuro-sama Mod![/h1]
This is a fan made mod for the Twitch streamer Neuro-sama and her sister Evil Neuro. It aims to be mainly a cosmetic mod, adding a bunch of references to the Neuro twins and their community.

The mod is still in beta-like state, so there are a few unfinished features and unsquashed bugs. If you find any, you can report them in the Discord thread or by creating an issue on Github.

Anyone is welcome to contribute to the mod! If you would like to participate in the discussion, join the Neuro-sama Discord and click the link to the mod’s thread below.
