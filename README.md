# Neuro-sama Mod for Terraria

This is a fan made mod for Twitch streamer Neuro-sama and her sister Evil Neuro. It aims to be mainly a cosmetic mod, adding a bunch of references to the Neuro twins and their community. You can find it on the steam workshop below or by searching in the mod browser.

The mod is still in beta-like state, so there are a few unfinished features and unsquashed bugs. If you find any, you can report themby creating an issue or in the Discord thread.

Anyone is welcome to contribute to the mod! If you would like to participate in the discussion, join the Neuro-sama Discord and click the link to the mod’s thread below.
