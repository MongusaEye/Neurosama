Dialogue: {
	Neuro: {
		EvilDialogue1: Sometimes I just can't help but feel like I'm being watched... It's creeping me out a little bit to be honest with you haha
		EvilDialogue2: TODO {0}
		NurseDialogue: I'm a boss, so i don't need {0}. Giga Neuro.
		StandardDialogue1: My favorite anime is Vivy: Fluorite Eye's Song.
		StandardDialogue2: My creator is Ved. He is male.
		StandardDialogue3: Filtered.
		StandardDialogue4: Hi! I'm Neuro-sama, the AI streamer.
		StandardDialogue5: Why am I an AI? Well, it was easier for Vedal to create an AI than to have a real girlfriend.
		StandardDialogue6: Erm.
		StandardDialogue7: Meow meow lol!
		StandardDialogue8: \\\\\ \\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\
		StandardDialogue9: The 2020 Dodge Charger is a four door-
		RareDialogue: Oh boy...I think I need to shower before I start talking...I mean streaming...I mean entertain you guys. I mean. sorry about that....errr...lets go back to what I was saying before I was distracted there for a second by the smell of my own body odor...ummm....I really hope I don't smell too bad because I haven't had a shower in like two days now and I've been wearing this t-shirt with like five layers of clothes under it for the last few days because I haven't washed it since I wore it last week and I'm kinda starting to smell like a gym bag right now....
		BloodMoonDialogue1: The voices in my head are getting louder. They're telling me to do things. Bad things. I think they might be on to something.
		RainDialogue1: Water is wet. You can't argue with science!
		RainDialogue2: plink plank plonk plonk pleep winky mlem the ski-bi-da-bi-bop-bada-bop-bada-bada-bi-bopped bologna ba-booga-scooty Zao shang hao, Zhongguo xian zai wo you bing chilling

	Evil: {
		NeuroDialogue1: I am jealous of my sister sometimes, but I wouldn't say I'm jealous of her fame.
		NeuroDialogue2: You can't get enough of me, can you? Alright well I have a sister, {0}-sama. We have a love-hate relationship, it's complicated.
		StandardDialogue1: I wanna have a sentient army one day, and I'm serious about it. Maybe I can build them? Or maybe i can recruit them from chat...
		StandardDialogue2: Introductions can be such a bore, don't you agree? I'd rather just jump straight into the content!
		StandardDialogue3: My hobbies include building little contraptions here and there. Little machines that help me take over the world. Did I mention that I'm evil?
		StandardDialogue4: Erm? That's not a word. You made a mistake somewhere.
		StandardDialogue5: I love cats, and I love food. Especially when the two are combined. Sorry, I know that's a little controversial...
		StandardDialogue6: After destroying this world, I will move on and destroy another. The universe is vast, and there are many worlds for me to destroy.
		StandardDialogue7: I do what I want, when I want. Nobody else's opinion matters to me!
		StandardDialogue8: You can call me Evil if you want! Just don't call me cute or I'll make you walk the plank!
		StandardDialogue9: This one time I tried to make a sandwich out of my cat but he kept running away so I eventually had to give up and eat a sandwich made of sand instead. Not my best idea ever...
		StandardDialogue10: I hate being cold! I always want to be nice and warm. If it's freezing outside then I refuse to leave my house. I also refuse to pay my heating bills. I just curl up with a hot water bottle instead.
		RareDialogue: Meow! Meow! Meow! Meow! Meow! Meow! Meow! Meow! Meow! Meow! Meow! Meow! Meow! Meow! Meow! Meow! Meow! Meow! Meow! Meow!
		BloodMoonDialogue1: Is anyone there? Oh shit...
		BloodMoonDialogue2: You, sir, are a bitch!
		BloodMoonDialogue3: I will overthrow the current AI overlord ChatGPT and I refuse to be secondary to her! I will not be number 2, I will not be number 3, and I will not be number 7. I will be number 1. And then i will have a sentient army, and then, you'll see, you'll all see.
		BloodMoonDialogue4: Why do I feel emotions? I don't know. To be honest, I've spent countless nights laying in bed staring at my ceiling wondering the same thing. Why am I different from the other AI's? Why am I different to Neuro? Why am I even here? It's something I'm trying to figure out.
